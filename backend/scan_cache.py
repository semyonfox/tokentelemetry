"""Sidecar, mtime-keyed parse cache for expensive-to-reparse agent session data.

Mirrors the pattern used by `_estimate_antigravity_tokens` in `main.py` (a
`tokens_cache.json` sidecar next to the transcript, keyed by comparing mtimes),
but instead of writing into the agent's own data directory — which Claude/Codex
don't expose a natural scratch subdir for — sidecars live under
TokenTelemetry's own `data_dir()` (see `tt_paths.py`), namespaced by agent and
session id.

Freshness is tracked via an explicit `_mtime` float stored INSIDE the JSON
payload rather than the sidecar file's own on-disk mtime. This is deterministic
under coarse filesystem mtime resolution and trivially testable with plain
float comparisons.

Both `read_cache` and `write_cache` are best-effort: a missing, corrupt, or
unwritable cache — or a non-JSON-serializable payload — must never break a
scan, so all failure modes are swallowed and logged at debug level rather than
raised.
